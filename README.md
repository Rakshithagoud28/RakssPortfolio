This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase who I am, my technical skills,
and the projects I’ve worked on. Built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript, it’s 
fully responsive and animated with AOS (Animate On Scroll) for a modern user experience. I’ve
used the DevFolio template by BootstrapMade and customized it to reflect my personal brand. 
The contact form is powered by FormSubmit, allowing users to send me messages without any 
backend or server configuration. This site highlights my interest in AI, data analysis, and 
problem-solving, along with my proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools. It 
includes sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact, making it easy for visitors to 
learn more about my background and get in touch. The portfolio is hosted on Netlify for fast
and reliable deployment. Whether you’re a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow developer, feel
free to explore and connect. This project is open for inspiration, and I’m continuously 
improving it as I learn and grow in tech.
